                    example: 'To measure software delivery performance, more and more organizations are adopting four key metrics as interpreted by the DORA research program: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and improvement failure enhancement. Its statistical analysis shows a clear delivery and search among high performers that provides a great indicator of performance for the same time, or even an entire organization.'
